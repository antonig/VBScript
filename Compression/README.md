# Compression
File compression in VBS

## lzw.vbs
An implemantation of the LZW algorithm. Not so fast, compresion requires 5 segs per MB. Decompression is much faster.

## ascii-art-rle.vbs
Uses a homebrew variant of the RLE line algorithm to compress ASCII art images with a lot of spaces. Not so good with images with shade gradients.
